# Lego NXT

Hints, tips, and tricks for the LEGO NXT Mindstorms robotics system.

## Getting started

- **Install**  
  On Windows 10 PC, the IDE from Lego does not always install.
  See [install](install/install.md) for some installation tips, 
  extra resources (images), and resetting a clicking brick.
  
- **IDE**  
  NXT-G is the IDE (integrated development environment) of Lego Mindstorms NXT.
  It does have its quirks. See [ide](ide/ide.md) for some tips.

- **Blocks**  
  The NXT-G IDE comes with several "blocks" (subroutines, library functions), but you can also make your own.
  See [blocks](blocks/blocks.md) for some tips.

## Projects

- **Simon**  
  The _Simon says_ game, no documentation, only [code](simon).

- **Lego club**  
  I run a Lego club in the village, were 8-12 year old children make robots using Lego Mindstorms NXT.
  The exercises of the [lego club](legoclub) are in Dutch only.
