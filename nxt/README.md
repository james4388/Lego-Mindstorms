# Lego NXT

Hints, tips, and tricks for the LEGO NXT Mindstorms robotics system.


## The Lego NXT-G IDE

NXT-G is the IDE (integrated development environment); it does have its quirks.
See [ide](ide/ide.md) for some tips.


## Blocks 

The NXT-G IDE comes with several "blocks" (subroutines, library functions), but you can also make your own.
See [blocks](blocks/blocks.md) for some tips.


## Install

On Windows 10 PC, the IDE from Lego does not always install.
See [install](install/install.md) for some installation tips, 
extra resources (images), and resetting a clicking brick.
