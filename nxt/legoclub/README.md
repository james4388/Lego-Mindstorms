# Lego club De Pracht

I run a Lego club in the village, were 8-12 year old children make robots using Lego Mindstorms NXT.
The exercises [pdf](LegoClub.pdf) or [word](LegoClub.docx) are in Dutch only.

I sometimes get invited by a local primary school during the tech-week. 
I then have one-morning sessions with NXT ([pdf](KennisMakingNXT.pdf) or [word](KennisMakingNXT.docx))
but also the school's EV3 ([pdf](KennisMakingEV3.pdf) or [word](KennisMakingEV3.docx))
