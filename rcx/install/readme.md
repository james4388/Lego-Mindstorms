# Install RCX

Some nice info on [pbricks](https://pbrick.info).


## RCX firnware

I have an RCX 1.0 (9719) and RCX 1.5 (9747).
I also have an USB-to-IDE-adapter, normally used for harddisks, to mount an DVD reader that I rescued
from a desktop PC, to my laptop.
I copied the RCX firmware files from the LEGO CDs and stored a copy [here](firmware).

Copies can also be found on [pbricks](https://pbrick.info/rcx-firmware/index.html).
