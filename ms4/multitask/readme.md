# Cooperative multi-tasking

This project is an attempt to use for cooperative multi-tasking in Lego Mindstorms 4 Robot inventor.

## Steps

I took these steps

 - I based cooperative multi-tasking on _generators_ in python.
   So I first studied generators, which are a special kind of iterators.
   All on the PC, not on Mindstorms; see the [iterator study](iteratorstudy).
 
 - Still on PC I tried out cooperative multi-tasking.
   This uses sub generators to wait.
   See the [tasks study](tasksstudy).
 
 - Last step was to make a [traffic light](trafficlight.md).
   This closely follows the task study, but now really runs on the brick.
